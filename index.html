            <ul id="tribute-info">
                <li><span class="bold">1955</span>- he was born in San Francisco, California</li>

                    for a job. He was soon hired by Atari, Inc. in Los Gatos, California, as a computer technician</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1976</span>- Wozniak completed the basic design of the Apple I computer and
                    showed it to Jobs, who suggested that they sell it; Wozniak was at first skeptical of the idea but
                    later agreed</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1977</span>- Jobs and Wozniak introduced the Apple II at the West Coast Computer
                    Faire.[76] It is the first consumer product to have been sold by Apple Computer. Primarily designed
                    by Wozniak, Jobs oversaw the development of its unusual case and Rod Holt developed the unique power
                    supply.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1978</span>-at age 23, Jobs was worth over $1 million (equivalent to $4.49
                    million in 2022). By age 25, his net worth grew to an estimated $250 million (equivalent to $805
                    million in 2022). He was also one of the youngest "people ever to make the Forbes list of the
                    nation's richest people—and one of only a handful to have done it themselves, without inherited
                    wealth".</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1982</span>- Jobs bought an apartment on the top two floors of The San Remo, a
                    Manhattan building with a politically progressive reputation. Although he never lived there, he
                    spent years renovating it thanks to I. M. Pei.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1983</span>- Jobs lured John Sculley away from Pepsi-Cola to serve as Apple's
                    CEO, asking, "Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a
                    chance to change the world?</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1986</span>- Jobs funded the spinout of The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar)
                    from Lucasfilm's computer graphics division for the price of $10 million, $5 million of which was
                    given to the company as capital and $5 million of which was paid to Lucasfilm for technology rights.
